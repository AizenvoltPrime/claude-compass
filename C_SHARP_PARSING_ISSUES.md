# C# Parsing Issues Analysis

## Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING ⚠️

**Symbol Extraction**: ✅ **WORKING** - All C# symbols (classes, methods, interfaces) properly detected
**Method Call Dependencies**: ❌ **BROKEN** - Zero method call relationships detected

## Verified Test Results

### ✅ What Works
- **File Discovery**: 192 C# files discovered and processed
- **Symbol Extraction**: 4,543 symbols extracted (classes, methods, interfaces, variables)
- **Inheritance Detection**: Interface implementations working (`CardManager : ICardDataProvider`)
- **Generic Types**: `<T>` parameters properly extracted
- **Async Methods**: `async` keyword preserved in signatures
- **Large File Support**: Files >35KB processed with chunking

### ❌ Critical Issue: Method Call Dependencies
- **SetHandPositions**: 0 callers, 0 dependencies
- **DrawCard**: 0 callers, 0 dependencies
- **All methods**: Show 0 callers and 0 dependencies
- **MCP Tools**: who_calls() and list_dependencies() return empty results

## Root Cause
Method call dependency extraction is completely non-functional. While symbols are extracted correctly, the relationships between them (method calls, field access) are not being stored in the database.

## Impact
- ✅ Code navigation works (can find all symbols)
- ❌ Dependency analysis broken (cannot trace method calls)
- ❌ Refactoring support incomplete (missing call relationships)
- ❌ Architecture analysis limited (no method-level connections)

## Test Evidence
```
CardManager.SetHandPositions found ✅
HandManager.SetHandPositions found ✅
IHandManager.SetHandPositions found ✅
who_calls(SetHandPositions) → 0 results ❌
list_dependencies(SetHandPositions) → 0 results ❌
```

## Technical Details

### Database Analysis
- **Total C# dependencies**: 91 stored (63 `implements`, 28 `inherits`)
- **Method call dependencies**: 0 stored (should be `calls` type)
- **Parser extracts calls**: ✅ Code shows extraction logic exists
- **Storage failure**: ❌ Extracted calls not reaching database

### Confirmed Method Call Chain
Real code analysis shows these calls should be detected:
```csharp
// DeckController.cs:226
_cardManager.SetHandPositions(_handPosition, null);

// DeckController.cs:242
_cardManager.SetHandPositions(playerHandPos, _handPosition);

// CardManager.cs:242
_handManager?.SetHandPositions(playerHandPosition, opponentHandPosition);
```

### Parser Implementation Status
- **Symbol extraction**: `src/parsers/csharp.ts:442-539` ✅ Working
- **Method call parsing**: `extractCallDependency()` ✅ Logic exists
- **Dependency types supported**: `invocation_expression`, `member_access_expression`, `conditional_access_expression`
- **Storage mechanism**: ❌ Calls not persisted to database

## Recommendation
C# parsing is **NOT production ready** for dependency analysis. Symbol extraction works perfectly, but the critical method call relationship detection is completely broken, making it unsuitable for refactoring or architectural analysis tasks.
