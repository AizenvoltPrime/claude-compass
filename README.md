# Claude Compass

> An AI-native development environment that solves the "context starvation" problem by giving AI assistants the same contextual understanding that senior engineers carry mentally.

**üéâ Phase 2 Complete!** - Full JavaScript/TypeScript framework analysis with Vue.js, Next.js, React, and Node.js support is ready for production use.

## What is Claude Compass?

Claude Compass creates a "closed loop" system between code reality and development intent. Instead of AI assistants making elegant-looking suggestions that break hidden dependencies, this system provides them with complete contextual understanding of your codebase.

## The Problem

AI assistants suffer from **context starvation** - they make decisions without understanding:
- Hidden dependencies and business context
- Blast radius of changes
- Framework-specific relationships
- Legacy system interactions
- Cross-cutting concerns

**Result**: Code that looks good but breaks critical batch jobs, APIs, and legacy systems.

## The Solution

### Core Capabilities

**üîç Reverse-Map Reality from Code**
- Parse codebases with Tree-sitter
- Build multiple graph types (files, symbols, framework-specific)
- Generate dependency-aware summaries

**üìã Generate Forward Specifications**
- Transform problem statements into PRDs, user stories, schemas, prototypes
- Use as guardrails during implementation

**üîå MCP Integration**
- Expose graphs and tools via Model Context Protocol
- Enable AI assistants to query ground truth instead of guessing

**üîÑ Sync & Drift Detection**
- Monitor spec-to-code alignment
- Detect missing endpoints, schema drift, unreferenced code

### Supported Frameworks

**Sequential Implementation:**
- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ **JavaScript/TypeScript Foundation** - **COMPLETED** with enhanced parser robustness
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ **JavaScript/TypeScript Framework Analysis** (Vue.js, Next.js, React, Node.js) - **COMPLETED**
- **Phase 3**: **Advanced JavaScript/TypeScript Graphs** (Background jobs, ORM mapping, test linkage)
- **Phase 4**: **PHP** (Laravel)
- **Phase 5**: **C#** (Godot game engine)
- **Phase 6**: **Python** (Django, FastAPI, Flask)

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Parser**: Tree-sitter with language-specific grammars
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Search**: Hybrid vector embeddings + full-text search (RRF fusion)
- **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization
- **MCP Server**: Node.js/TypeScript implementation
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI Ada v2 or similar

### Graph Types
- **File Graph**: Import/export relationships
- **Symbol Graph**: Function calls, inheritance, references
- **Framework Graphs**: Routes, dependency injection, jobs, ORM entities
